[[Essential Components of Web Accessibility]](/fundamentals/components/)
:   Shows how web accessibility depends on several components of web development and interaction working together and shows the relationship between the WAI guidelines: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG](/standards-guidelines/wcag/)), Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines ([ATAG](/standards-guidelines/atag/)), and User Agent Accessibility Guidelines ([UAAG](/standards-guidelines/uaag/)).

[[Accessibility Principles]](/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/)
:   Helps developers, designers, and others to understand the principles  for creating accessible websites, web applications, browsers, and other web tools. Provides references to the international standards from W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and to [stories of web users](/people-use-web/user-stories/).

[[Web Accessibility Perspectives: Explore the Impact and Benefits for Everyone]](/perspective-videos/)
:   **Videos** that demonstrate that web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all.
